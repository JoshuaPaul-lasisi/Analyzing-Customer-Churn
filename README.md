# Customer Churn Analysis with Excel

This repository contains an analysis of customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle. The analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel to explore data, generate insights, and visualize churn patterns.

## Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, especially in highly competitive industries such as telecommunications. Understanding the factors that lead to customer churn can help businesses develop strategies to retain customers and reduce turnover. This project aims to identify the key drivers of customer churn using Excel for data analysis and visualization.

## Dataset

The Telco Customer Churn dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. It includes information about a telecommunications company's customers, such as demographic details, account information, and service usage patterns.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: The raw dataset (`Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`) and any intermediate files generated during the analysis.
- **Analysis**: The main Excel workbook (`Customer_Churn_Analysis.xlsx`) containing the data analysis, including:
  - Data Cleaning and Preparation
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Churn Rate Calculation
  - Visualization of Key Metrics
  - Insights and Conclusions
- **Documentation**: Additional documentation, including this README file and any supporting documents.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarizing data to understand distribution and relationships between variables.
- **Churn Analysis**: Calculating churn rates and identifying patterns in churned vs. retained customers.
- **Visualization**: Using Excel charts and graphs to illustrate key findings and trends.

## Results

The analysis highlights several important factors influencing customer churn, such as contract type, tenure, and service usage patterns. Key insights include:

- Customers with month-to-month contracts have higher churn rates compared to those with longer-term contracts.
- Tenure is inversely related to churn; customers with longer tenures are less likely to churn.
- Certain services, such as tech support and online security, have significant impacts on customer retention.
